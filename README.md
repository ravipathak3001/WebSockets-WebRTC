**Project setup**
-----------------

Being in main project dir hit 

    npm i

  it will install all the required dependencies for the server side
    
now for client side go to client dir and install required dependencies

    cd ./client
    npm i
    

Once we have our **all packages,** installed for running the server go back to the main project dir. and run the server

    cd ../
    npm run dev

when server is already running to run the client side got to client dir. and run the client side

    cd ./client
    npm start
